# Contributing

Welcome to AppImage. A good starting point for most questions is our wiki at https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki.

### I would like to request an AppImage for an application

If there is no AppImage of your favorite application available, please request it from the author(s) of the application, e.g., as a feature request in the issue tracker of the application. For example, if you would like to see an AppImage of Mozilla Firefox, then please leave a comment at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1249971. The more people request an AppImage from the upstream authors, the more likely is that an AppImage will be provided.

### I would like to provide an AppImage for my application

If you are an application author and would like to make your application available as an AppImage, please start here: https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/Creating-AppImages. Feel free to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/issues) in the AppImageKit project if you need support using the tools provided by AppImageKit.

### I would like to have my AppImage included in the AppImageHub central directory of available AppImages

Please see the [AppImageHub Readme](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/blob/master/README.md).

### I would like to contribute to AppImageKit development

If you would like to report issues with AppImageKit itself, or would like to contribute to its development, please see our [list of issues](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/issues) and get in touch with us in `#AppImage` on `irc.libera.chat`. We welcome pull requests addressing any of the open issues and/or other bugfixes and/or feature additions. In the case of complex feature additions, it is best to contact us first, before you spend much time.
