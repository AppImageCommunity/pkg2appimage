    <p>
      pkg2appimage is a tool that lets you generate AppImage files from existing packages. An AppImage
      is a self-running bundle that contains an application and everything
      it needs to run that cannot reasonably expected to be part of each target system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can include libraries that are not commonly available on target systems,
      resources such as translations, icons, fonts, and other auxiliary files.
      pkg2appimage makes it easy to take an existing package (e.g., a deb)
      and turn it into an AppImage.
