# About `.yml` files

The easiest way to build an AppImage is to write a `.yml` file. We developed a rather simple format that allows developers to write a `app.yml` file that describes how to build an AppImage for `app`, being able to reuse pre-built binaries, e.g. from Debian packages, both to save time for creating and building an AppImage.

This document provides an introduction to the `.yml` files' purpose, their structure and a few examples describing how to use all the advanced features.


## Purpose of `.yml` files

`.yml` is the file extension commonly used for _YAML_ (_Yet Another Markup Language_, nowadays also serves as an abbreviation for _YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language_).

YAML's approach to describing data is to combine associative lists (known as `dict`s in Python or `object literal`s in JavaScript, for example), lists (arrays) and scalar values. This results in an easy to parse and also easy to read format.

The `.yml` files are used by [`pkg2appimage`](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/pkg2appimage/blob/master/pkg2appimage) which is used in the _AppImages_ project to convert binary _ingredients_ into AppImages for demonstration purposes. Their primary objective is to make it very simple to convert pre-existing binaries into the AppImage format. If you can build your software from source, you may generate AppImages directly as part of your build workflow; in this case you may not need a `.yml` file (but a Travis CI `.travis.yml` and/or a `Makefile`, etc.).

The `.yml` file format is not part of the AppImage standard, which just describes the AppImage container format and is agnostic as to how the payload inside an AppImage gets generated. Neither it is part of AppImageKit, because AppImageKit is only concerned with taking a pre-existing _AppDir_ and converting that into an AppImage. Such an AppDir is created from the instructions stored in the `.yml` files, and converted to an AppImage using _AppImageKit_.



## General anatomy of `.yml` files

The general format of `.yml` files is as follows:

```
app: (name of the application)
(optional flags)

ingredients:
  (instructions that describe from where to get
  the binary ingredients used for the AppImage)

script:
  (instuctions on how to convert these ingredients to an AppImage)
```

As you can see, the `.yml` file consists of three sections:

1. The __overall section__ (containing the name of the application and optional flags)
2. The __ingredients section__ (describing from where to get the binary ingredients used for the AppImage)
3. The __script section__ (describing how to convert these ingredients to an AppImage)

Note that the sections may contain sub-sections. For example, the ingredients section can also have a script section containing instuctions on how to determine the most recent version of the ingredients and how to download them.


### Overall section

#### `app` key

Mandatory. Contains the name of the application. If the `.yml` file uses ingredients from packages (e.g., `.deb`), then the name must match the package name of the main executable.


#### Keys that enable ability to relocate

Optional. Either `binpatch: true` or `union: true`. These keys enable workarounds that make it possible to run applications from different, changing places in the filesystem (i.e., make them relocateable) that are not made for this. For example, some applications contain hardcoded paths to a compile-time `$PREFIX` such as `/usr`. This is generally discouraged, and application authors are asked to use paths relative to the main executable instead. Libraries like _binreloc_ exist to make this easier. Since many applications are not relocateable yet, there are workarounds which can be used by one of these keys:

* `binpatch: true`  indicates that binaries in the AppImage should be patched to replace the string `/usr` by the string `././`,  an `AppRun` file should be put inside the AppImage that does a `chdir()` to the `usr/` directory of inside AppDir before executing the payload application. The net effect is this that applications can find their resources in the  `usr/` directory inside the AppImage as long as they do not internally use `chdir()` operations themselves.
* `union: true` indicates that an `AppRun` file should be put inside the AppImage that tries to create the impression of a union filesystem, effectively creating the impression to the payload application that the contents of the AppImage are overlayed over `/`. This can be achieved, e.g., using `LD_PRELOAD` and a library that redirects filesystem calls. This works as long as the payload application is a dynamically linked binary.


### Ingredients section

Describes how to acquire the binary ingredients that go into the AppImage. Binary ingredients can be archives like `.zip` files, packages like `.deb` files or APT repositories like Debian package archives or PPAs.

__NOTE:__ In the future, source ingredients could also be included in the `.yml` file definition. Source ingredients could include tarballs and Git repositories. It would probably be advantageous if we could share the definition with other formats like snapcraft's `.yaml` files. Proposals for this are welcome.

 `.yml` files are supposed not to hardcode version numbers, but determine the latest version at runtime. If the  `.yml` files describes the released version, it should determine the latest released version at runtime. If the  `.yml` files describes the development version, it might reference the latest nightly or continuous build instead.


#### Using ingredients from a binary archive

The following example ingredients section describes how to get the latest version of a binary archive:

```
ingredients:
  script:
    - DLD=$(wget -q "https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/releases/latest"  -O - | grep -E "https.*atom-amd64.tar.gz" | cut -d'"' -f4)
    - wget -c $DLD
    - tar zxvf atom*tar.gz
```

The `script` section inside the `ingredients` section determines its URL, downloads and extracts the binary archive.


#### Using ingredients from a debian repository

The following example ingredients section describes how to get the latest version of a package from a Debian archive:

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  sources:
    - deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
    - deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/KDAB/xUbuntu_14.04/ /
```

The `dist` section inside the `ingredients` section defines which Debian distribution should be used as a base. The `sources` section inside the `ingredients` section describes the repositories from which the package should be pulled. The entries are in the same format as lines in a debian `sources.list` file. Note that the `http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/isv:/KDAB/xUbuntu_14.04` repository needs the `http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/` repository so that the dependencies can be resolved.

__NOTE:__ In the future, other types of packages like `.rpm` could also be included in the  `.yml` file definition. Proposals for this are welcome if the proposer also implements support for this in the [`pkg2appimage`](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/pkg2appimage/blob/master/pkg2appimage) script.


#### Using ingredients from an Ubuntu PPA

This is a special case of a Debian repository. PPAs can be uniquely identified with the pattern `onwer/name` and can, for brevity, be specified like this:

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  sources:
    - deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
  ppas:
    - geany-dev/ppa
```

The `ppas` section inside the `ingredients` section lets you specify one or more Ubuntu PPAs. This is equivalent to, but more elegant than, adding the corresponding `sources.list` entries to the `sources` section inside the `ingredients` section.

__NOTE:__ In the future, similar shortcuts for other types of personal repositories, such as projects on openSUSE build service, could also be included in the `.yml` file definition. Proposals for this are welcome if the proposer also implements support for this in the [`pkg2appimage`](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/pkg2appimage/blob/master/pkg2appimage) script.

#### Using deb files from a download page

The following will fetch the first deb from https://www.bitwig.com/en/download.html:

```
  script:
    - URL=$(wget -q "https://www.bitwig.com/en/download.html" -O - | grep -oP -m1 "(https)[^'\"]+?.deb" | head -n 1)
    - wget -c "$URL"
    - echo "$URL" | cut -d "/" -f 5 > VERSION
```

#### Using local deb files

This allows the use of local deb files (rather than downloading the deb ingredients)

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  sources:
    - deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main universe
  debs:
    - /home/area42/kdenlive.deb
    - /home/area42/kdenlive/*
 ```
 
 As you can see, for a single file, just use
```
- /path/to/file.deb
```
And for all files in a directory (like local repository). Note that the end of the path ends with "`/*`":
```
- /path/to/local/repo/*
```
__Note:__ this is for personal use, if you use your recipe it will NOT work on another computer if the debs files are not in the specified directory


#### Excluding certain packages

Some packages declare dependencies that are not necessarily required to run the software. The `.yml` format allow overriding these by pretending that the packages are installed already. To exclude these dependencies (and any dependencies they would otherwise pull in), the packages have to be added to the `exclude` key in the `ingredients` section:

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  packages:
    - multisystem
    - gksu
  sources:
    - deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
    - deb http://liveusb.info/multisystem/depot all main
  exclude:
    - qemu
    - qemu-kvm
    - cryptsetup
    - libwebkitgtk-3.0-0
    - dmsetup
```
In this example, excluding `qemu` means that the qemu package and all of its dependencies that it would normally pull into the AppImage will be excluded from the AppImage (unless something else in the AppImage pulls in some of those depdencies already).

#### Pretending certain versions of dependencies being installed

The dependency information in some packages may result in the package manager to refuse the application to be installed if some __exact__ versions of dependencies are not present in the system. In this case, it may be necessary pretend the __exact__ version of a dependency to be installed on the target system by using the `pretend` key in the `ingredients` section:

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  sources:
    - deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
  ppas:
    - otto-kesselgulasch/gimp-edge
  pretend:
    - libcups2 1.7.2-0ubuntu1
```

The assumption here is that every target system has at least the pretended version available, and that newer versions of the pretended package are able to run the application just as well as the pretended version itself _(if this is not the case, then the pretended package has broken downward compatibility and should be fixed)_.


#### Arbitrary scripts in the ingredients section

You may add arbitrary shell commands to the `script` section inside the `ingredients` section in order to facilitate the retrieval of the binary ingredients. This allows building AppImages for complex situations as illustrated in the following example:

```
ingredients:
  script:
    - URL=$(wget -q https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html -O - | grep jar | cut -d '"' -f 10)
    - wget -c "$URL"
    - wget -c --no-check-certificate --no-cookies --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u66-b17/jre-8u66-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

This downloads the payload application, JabRef, and the required JRE which requires to set a special cookie header.

The script could also be used to fetch pre-built Debian packages from a GitHub release page, or to override the version of a package.

Use `post_script` instead of `script` if you need this to run _after_ the other ingredient processing has taken place.

### Script section

The `script` section may contain arbitrary shell commands that are required to translate the binary ingredients to an `AppDir` suitable for generating an AppImage.


#### The script section needs to copy ingedients into place

If `.deb` packages, Debian repositories or PPAs have been specified in the `ingredients` section, then their dependencies are resolved automatically (taking a blacklist of packages that are assumed to be present on all target systems in a recent enough version into account, such as glibc) and the packages are extracted into an AppDir. The shell commands contained in the `script` section are executed inside the root directory of this AppDir. However, some packages place things in non-standard locations, i.e. the main executable is outside of `usr/bin`. In these cases, the commands contained in the `script` section should normalize the filesystem structure. Sometimes it is also necessary to edit further files to reflect the changed file location. The following example illustrates this:

```
ingredients:
  dist: trusty
  sources:
    - deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty main universe
  script:
    - DLD=$(wget -q "https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-desktop/releases/" -O - | grep _amd64.deb | head -n 1 | cut -d '"' -f 2)
    - wget -c "https://github.com/$DLD"

script:
  - mv opt/webtorrent-desktop/* usr/bin/
  - sed -i -e 's|/opt/webtorrent-desktop/||g' webtorrent-desktop.desktop
```

In the `ingredients` section, a `.deb` package is downloaded. Then, in the `script` section, the main executable is moved to its standard location in the AppDir. Finally, the `.desktop` file is updated to reflect this.

If other types of binary ingredients have been specified, then the shell commands contained in the `script` section need to retrieve these by copying them into place. Note that since the commands contained in the `script` section are executed inside the root directory of the AppDir, the ingredients downloaded in the `ingredients` sections are one directory level above, i.e., in `../`. The following example illustrates this:

```
ingredients:
  script:
    - wget -c "https://telegram.org/dl/desktop/linux" --trust-server-names
    - tar xf tsetup.*.tar.xz

script:
  - cp ../Telegram/Telegram ./usr/bin/telegram-desktop
```

In the `ingredients` section, an archive is downloaded and unpacked. Then, in the `script` section, the main executable is copied into place inside the AppDir.


### The script section needs to copy icon and `.desktop` file in place

Since an AppImage may contain more than one executable binary (e.g. helper binaries launched by the main executable) and also may contain multiple `.desktop` files, a clear entry point into the AppImage is required. For this reason, there is the convention that there should be exactly one `$ID.desktop` file and corresponding icon file in the top-level directory of the AppDir.

The script running the `.yml` file tries to do this automatically, which works if the name of the application specified in the `app:` key matches the name of the `$ID.desktop` file and the corresponding icon file. For example, if `app: myapp` is set, and there is `usr/bin/myapp`, `usr/share/applications/myapp.desktop`, and `usr/share/icons/*/myapp.png`, then the `myapp.desktop` and `myapp.png` files are automatically copied into the top-level directory of the AppDir. Unfortunately, many packages are  in their naming. In that case, the shell commands contained in the `script` section must copy exactly one `$ID.desktop` file and the corresponding icon file into the top-level directory of the AppDir. The following example illustrates this:

```
script:
  - tar xf ../fritzing* -C usr/bin/ --strip 1
  - mv usr/bin/fritzing.desktop .
```

Unfortunately, many applications don't include a `$ID.desktop` file. If it is missing, the shell commands contained in the `script` section need to create it. The following (simplified) example illustrates this:

```
script:
  - # Workaround for:
  - # https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=296568
  - cat > firefox.desktop <<EOF
  - [Desktop Entry]
  - Type=Application
  - Name=Firefox
  - Icon=firefox
  - Exec=firefox %u
  - Categories=GNOME;GTK;Network;WebBrowser;
  - MimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;
  - StartupNotify=true
  - EOF
```

__Note:__ The optional `desktopintegration` script assumes that the name of the application specified in the `app:` key matches the name of the `$ID.desktop` file and the corresponding main executable (case-sensitive). For example, if `app: myapp` is set, it expects `usr/bin/myapp`and `usr/share/applications/myapp.desktop`. For this reason, if you want to use the optional `desktopintegration` script, you may rearrange the AppDir. The following example illustrates this:

```
script:
  - cp ./usr/share/applications/FBReader.desktop fbreader.desktop
  - sed -i -e 's|Exec=FBReader|Exec=fbreader|g' fbreader.desktop
  - sed -i -e 's|Name=.*|Name=FBReader|g' fbreader.desktop
  - sed -i -e 's|Icon=.*|Icon=fbreader|g' fbreader.desktop
  - mv usr/bin/FBReader usr/bin/fbreader
  - cp usr/share/pixmaps/FBReader.png fbreader.png
```
