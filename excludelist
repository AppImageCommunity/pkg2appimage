# This file lists libraries that we will assume to be present on the host system and hence

# over time. File format: one filename per line. Each entry should have a justification comment.

libc.so.6
# Workaround for:
# relocation error: usr/lib/libc.so.6: symbol _dl_starting_up, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 with link time reference

libdl.so.2
# Workaround for:
# Segmentation fault

libstdc++.so.6
# Workaround for:
# usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found

libm.so.6
# Workaround for:
# relocation error: usr/lib/libm.so.6: symbol __get_cpu_features, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference

libpthread.so.0
# Workaround for:
# usr/bin/inkscape: relocation error: usr/lib/libpthread.so.0: symbol h_errno, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference

libresolv.so.2
# Workaround for:
# usr/lib/libresolv.so.2: symbol h_errno, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference

libGL.so.1
# Workaround for:
# Different distributions put dri/ libraries in different places, which are not found if we supply a bundled libGL.so.1
# /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so
# /usr/lib64/dri/swrast_dri.so

libdrm.so.2
# Workaround for:

# libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
# libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
# Unrecognized OpenGL version

libxcb.so.1
# Workaround for:
# Fedora 23
# symbol lookup error: /lib64/libxcb-dri3.so.0: undefined symbol: xcb_send_fd
# Uncertain if this is required to be bundled for some distributions - if so we need to write a version check script and use LD_PRELOAD to load the system version if it is newer

libX11.so.6
# Workaround for:
# Fedora 23
# symbol lookup error: ./lib/libX11.so.6: undefined symbol: xcb_wait_for_reply64

libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0
libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0
# Simply to reduce size - not known to cause issues

libasound.so.2
# Workaround for:
# No sound, e.g., in VLC.AppImage (does not find sound cards)

libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0
# Workaround for:
# On Ubuntu, get (inkscape:25621): GdkPixbuf-WARNING **: Error loading XPM image loader: Image type 'xpm' is not supported

libfontconfig.so.1
# Workaround for:
# Application stalls when loading fonts during application launch; e.g., KiCad on ubuntu-mate

libselinux.so.1
# Workaround for:
# sed: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

# The following are assumed to be part of the base system
# Removing these has worked e.g., for Krita. Feel free to report if
# you think that some of these should go into AppImages and why.

# Error initializing NSS without a persistent database: NSS error code: -5925
# nss_error=-5925, os_error=0
# libnss3.so should not be removed from the bundles, as this causes other issues, e.g.,
